# SelfAvoidingRandomWalk
This is my implementation of Self-avoiding random walk in Python using Monte-Carlo method. It receives the size of the lattice from the user as a system argument and visualizes the process on the screen. 

A description of this project can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLaw8ageZnA) (a lecture by Prof. Seyed Naser Razavi at the University of Tabriz. The lecture is in Persian).
