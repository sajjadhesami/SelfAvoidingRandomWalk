# SelfAvoidingRandomWalk
This is my implementation of Self-avoiding random walk in Python using Monte-Carlo method. It receives three arguments from the user (1) the size of the lattice, (2) the number of trials, and (3) a zero or one value to determine whether it should visualize the process on the screen or not.
It prints the movements of the random walker on the console.

The implementation uses "color.py" and "stddraw.py" from [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/code/).

A description of this project can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLaw8ageZnA) (a lecture by Prof. Seyed Naser Razavi at the University of Tabriz. The lecture is in Persian).
