# SelfAvoidingRandomWalk
This is my implementation of Self-avoiding random walk in Python using Monte-Carlo method. It receives two arguments (1) the size of the lattice and (2) the number of trials from the user as system arguments and visualizes the process on the screen. 

A description of this project can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLaw8ageZnA) (a lecture by Prof. Seyed Naser Razavi at the University of Tabriz. The lecture is in Persian).
